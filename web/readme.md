## Style of PPSUC OJ

To establish a concise and clear style of PPSUC OJ's front end, we have made some modifications to the original code.
- Replace the original information block class ``class='d-none d-sm-block'`` with ``class="d-none d-sm-block shadow-lg rounded" style='padding: 20px;'``
- Replace the original submission information block ``<div class="card border-info">`` with ``<div class="card border border-black mb-3 shadow-lg" style="border-radius: 25px;">``
- Add an outside div to the submission statistics block, and set the style to ``<div class="d-none d-sm-block rounded" style="padding: 20px;box-shadow: 5px 10px 15px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);">``

## Modify the standings

To modify the standings, we need to modify the function ``contest_standings`` in ``web/app/libs/uoj-contest-lib.php``.

We add some information to the standings, including ``sid``, ``jh``, and ``cla``.

And we need to modify the function ``get_standings_row_class`` in ``web/app/libs/uoj-contest-lib.php`` to show the information we added in the standings.

The corresponding js code is in ``web/js/uoj.js``.

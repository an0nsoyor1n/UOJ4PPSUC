  <li>Accepted: The answer is correct. Congratulations on passing this problem.</li>
  <li>Wrong Answer: The answer is incorrect. Passing sample data does not necessarily mean the answer is correct; there may be something you haven't considered.</li>
  <li>Runtime Error: Runtime error. Issues like illegal memory access, array out-of-bounds, pointer drift, or calling disabled system functions can cause this. Click for details in the evaluation report.</li>
  <li>Time Limit Exceeded: Time limit exceeded. Check if your program has an infinite loop or if there is a faster solution.</li>
  <li>Memory Limit Exceeded: Memory limit exceeded. Data may need compression, or your arrays might be too large. Check for memory leaks.</li>
  <li>Output Limit Exceeded: Output limit exceeded. Your output is much longer than the correct answer!</li>
  <li>Dangerous Syscalls: Dangerous system calls. Did you include files or use certain (dangerous) system functions? CTF participants should contact the Cyber SWAT Network Defense Department.</li>
  <li>Judgement Failed: Evaluation failed. There might be issues with the evaluation machine or server.</li>
  <li>No Comment: No details. If the evaluation machine has nothing to say about your program, you can report the situation to us or submit again.</li>

<p>For such problems, here are some possible reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In Linux, the newline character is '\n', while in Windows it is '\r\n' (one extra character). Some data generated on Windows may not work in the Linux evaluation environment. This is very common in string input.</li>
  <li>The evaluation system is built on Linux, which may cause CE due to the use of Linux reserved words, which work fine on Windows.</li>
  <li>Linux enforces stricter memory access controls. Invalid pointer or array index access that works on Windows may fail on the evaluation system.</li>
  <li>Severe memory leaks can trigger system protection modules to terminate your process. Therefore, any memory allocated using malloc (or calloc, realloc, new) should be completely released using free (or delete).</li>
  <li>Of course, the data might really be wrong. However, if multiple people have passed the problem, it's best not to suspect the data. Otherwise, report it to us immediately!</li>

<p>(It seems many people are unfamiliar with compiling multiple source files together. Hereâ€™s a guide from UOJ for reference.)</p>
<p>Interactive problems usually provide a header file to include and a source file called grader.</p>
<p>For C++: <code>g++ -o code grader.cpp code.cpp</code></p>
<p>For C: <code>gcc -o code grader.c code.c</code></p>
<p>If you're a computer novice, don't worry! You can simply paste the content of the grader file after your include statement in your code.</p>
<p>For Pascal: Generally, a grader is provided. You need to write a Pascal unit. The grader will use your unit. So, name your source file as the unit name + <code>.pas</code>, and then:</p>
<p>For Pascal: <code>fpc grader.pas</code></p>
